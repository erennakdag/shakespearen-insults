# Shakespearen Insults
Twitter Bot that says random Shakespearean Insults

This Twitter Bot was created using tweepy module in Python and the Elevated API Access via <https://developer.twitter.com>

### How it works:

The application listens to the account with the screen_name `@insultshakspear` and responds to tweets mentioning that screen_name with a randomly generated Shakespearen style swear word or insult.

The words in the insults was taken from <https://www.literarygenius.info/a1-shakespearean-insults-generator.htm>
